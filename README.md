# Simple twitch program.
Wanted to practice C++ and Qt so I started to code this simple program that uses Twitch.tv's API.

# What it does:
This is program that uses Twitch.tv's API to retrieve channel information,
stream information (if online) based on user's followed channel list.

This program only saves avatar picture of a channel and other information
is removed when the program is closed. 

Information that is being shown includes list of followed channels, channel name, game, avatar
picture, total views, online status, number of followers, channel url,
partner status, maturity status, creation date for channel and stream.

At this point also some information is taken but not used such as profile banner url, video banner url,
channel id, delay and preview picture url.
